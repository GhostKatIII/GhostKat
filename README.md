# GhostKat

GhostKat.org is a very simple method that replaces the two needs for a server, or intermediary of any kind (at least when it comes to torrenting). 

A database handling users posting and retrieving magnet links.
A method to secure users in their interactions with other users; preventing spam and maintaining system integrity.

To the first end, we use WebTorrent to handle the torrenting, and we call the magnet links from the blockchain using using Infura. The users device is able to make a call to the blockchain via Infura without any intermediary. To the second, we have put conditions for posting to most of the arrays.

# Palace Entrance
We have 6 arrays available to post on, based on how much trust you have in the community. We represent trust in Doubloonz, a cryptocurrency we generated to act as the key to our arrays. 

There is a free array called Mr. Bones. You don’t need any DBZ to post on Mr.Bones, but that is what makes it Mr.Bones, it’s crazy! 

The order of “palaces”, is as follows.

# Zero Palace - zPost - onlyOwner
# Legend Palace - legendPost - 999,999
# Kat Kafe - katPost - 27000
# Middle Palace - middlePost - 1000
# Open Palace - openPost - 333
# Lower Palace - lowerPost - 111
# Mr. Bones - Ridin - 0 

We have set a public buy price of one Ether for one thousand DBZ, with an initial supply of 3,999,999. The price is so high because we really don’t want people buying into the system before it has any value as that would dilute trust. The token and arrays are armed with a ban function which will prevent posting or transfer of DBZ from a specified account. The various levels only organize by trust, but we can simply add tags to the torrent names, and then subdivide the palace itself by media type.

We have a very straightforward roadmap for making DBZ a resilient democratic organization.

# 1: The Eternal Charity of GK
We will give away 999,999 total to the community for free, and then proceed to give away more to users who remain active and upload well. At the same time, we will load the contract with 999,999 for sale. After this we will be left with 2,000,001 DBZ. During this phase we will also upgrade the interfaces for the system, and run a contest for the best possible version of GhostKat.org.


# Phase II: Doubloonz Piracy Syndicate
We will transfer ownership of the DBZ tokens and the arrays over to a standards compliant DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) contract, which will be able to operate the contract by vote. The tokens themselves will act as voting shares in the DAO. This is a standard in the docs of Ethereum. 

# Phase III: The Eternal Koin Offering
We will distribute the rest of our initial supply to the rest of the community, giving the system resilience against dilution. From that point forward the Doubloonz Piracy Syndicate will be the sole operator of the GhostKat TV magnet arrays, and the DBZ Eternal Koin Offering. The EKO will be a method for raising money within the community so long as the community remains active.

# Public Alpha
The version of GhostKat.org currently live is a prototype with a limited capacity of visible torents. It is only showing posts the first ten posts of the middle palace. We have a version that loads all the palace torrent into different tables, and has a capacity of hundreds of thousands. But, before we go ahead and let everyone into the system, we need to test it publicly. Over the next few weeks we will expand the interface based on the amount of content being posted on the system.
