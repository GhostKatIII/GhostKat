**GhostKat** is here to haunt internet data and ad companies, government censors and copyright trolls. It has been disturbed from eternal rest by ever-encroaching shareholders and ill-informed politicians who threaten to lock down the world's most powerful resource for sharing knowledge and art, the world-wide-web. 

To do this, it's re-animated a website that uses WebTorrent to call magnet links stored on a globally-distributed Ethereum Smart Contract. Since it exists on the blockchain rather than a traditional host server, the links are unowned and cannot be deleted or destroyed. Anyone with the contract ABI can read off the ledgers - *even behind China's "Great Firewall."* This contract also hosts the Dubloonz (DBZ) crypto-currency, which is used as a permission gate for different ledgers attached to the contract. These gates also ensure only certain people can post to certain ledgers based on how many tokens they own, a new feature for blockchain dApps ("decentralized applications"). 

3,999 Dubloonz were minted for this platform. 999 are up for exchange for Ethereum (ETH) at 1 DBZ per 1 ETH, as an "Eternal Koin Offer". This is not an ICO, however success of this platform would likely drive up the price of Ethereum. DBZ are tradable as well, but mind that assets can be frozen by the creator if they are misused. In order to exchange ETH for DBZ, as well as post to the ledger system, you must set up the contract ABI in an ERC-20 compatible wallet. Parity is recommmended: https://parity.io/. You then buy DBZ using the "buy()" function. Simply transferring to the address like with many ICOs will not work. You can find a full tutorial for buying and posting via Parity here: https://dontpanicsell.com/2017/11/18/dbz/

**The requirements for posting to each ledger are as follows:**
-  MrB: 0 DBZ (anybody can post using the Ridin() function!)
-  lowerPlane:   1 DBZ
-  openPalace:   3 DBZ
-  middlePalace: 5 DBZ
-  katKafe:      27 DBZ
-  legendPalace: 99 DBZ

Come see the test site at http://ghostkat.org. It currently only loads correctly on Chrome. The first 33 posts of the lowerPlane ledger are shown. If the post is a WebTorrent-compatible magnet, it will load the magnet into the player. The use of WebTorrent enables peer-2-peer hosting of content where the more viewers there are, the more distributed the seeding will be and thus the faster the media will load. The site uses web3.js and Infura to call the ledger content client-side, the site's host server only hosts the web page. 

This is proof-of-concept for a more open, more readily anonymous internet that is both created and distributed by everyone, not just a few big corporations who in turn attempt to influence laws in their favors (especially Net Neutrality).

GhostKat is designed to be a collective project. While the first 999 DBZ are up for exchange, another 999 DBZ will be given away as bounties for contributing to the project. The site and features are bare-bones to begin with, and community participation should drive the evolution of GhostKat. The last 2000ish DBZ will stay in the creator's hands, to be mostly given away later as the community gets moving with trustworthy individuals. More tokens can be minted easily as well, with adjustible prices. Initial sale of tokens goes straight into development and supporting the new community. The first release was programmed on a phone and a 1GB RAM netbook.

With successful formation of the Dubloonz Piracy Syndikate (DPS), a "Distributed Autonomous Organization" (DAO), ownership of GhostKat will transfer to the community to manage token sale and the ledger system, including minting and selling tokens at a new price, banning users, or migrating the ledger smart contract to something with higher functionality.

**Here are the initial bounties:**

- DJ KatMixMeow: 27 DBZ - Write functional mobile-first music streaming interface (with playlists and looping) for ghostkat.org.
- Leaky boat: 10 DBZ - Fix ghostkat.org for mobile and firefox. It's an issue with web3.js
- Focus Fire: 3 DBZ - Post a magnet link to MrB seeding at high speed via WebTorrent.

Thank you so much for supporting us! We welcome all feedback and would especially welcome partners!
